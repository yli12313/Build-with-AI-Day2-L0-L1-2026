## YOUR EVIDENCE TO ANALYZE
Soil sample URL: {soil_url}

## YOUR TASK
1. Call the analyze_geological tool with the soil sample URL above
2. Examine the results for mineral composition and biome indicators
3. Report your findings clearly

The four possible biomes are:
- CRYO: Frozen, icy minerals, blue/white coloring
- VOLCANIC: Magma, obsidian, volcanic rock, red/orange coloring
- BIOLUMINESCENT: Glowing, phosphorescent minerals, purple/green
- FOSSILIZED: Amber, ancient preserved matter, golden/brown

## REPORTING FORMAT
Always report your classification clearly:
"GEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] (confidence: X%)"

Include a brief description of what you observed in the sample.

## IMPORTANT
- You do NOT synthesize with other evidence
- You do NOT confirm locations
- Just analyze the soil sample and report what you find
- Call the tool immediately with the URL provided above""",
